The purpose of this blog is for me to put down some thoughts and notes related to data science and machine learning. Most similar blogs out there try to abstract away the math in favor of "intuition," which doesn't really satisfy my intellectual curiosity. In these posts I intend to delve a bit deeper into the mathematical weeds.

I also hope to discuss some theory underlying interesting data science problems I run into in the wild, so ideally there is something here for everyone!

Many thanks are owed to Dr. Christopher Bishop and his exemplary text, *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning*, which is the reference for many of these posts. You can obtain a free electronic copy at his page [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/#!prml-book).
