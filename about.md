The purpose of this blog is for me to put down some thoughts and notes related to data science and machine learning. Most similar blogs out there try to abstract away the math in favor of "intuition," which doesn't really satisfy my intellectual curiosity. In these posts I hope to delve a bit deeper into the mathematical weeds.

I also intend to discuss some theory underlying interesting data science problems at work, so ideally there is something here for everyone!

Code is not my top priority. When writing toy implementations I often find myself losing sight of the big picture and having to wrestle with practical but uninteresting concerns. I'm not interested in the numerical stability of sigmoid functions, for example. However, I may use some posts as motivation to pick up Julia.
